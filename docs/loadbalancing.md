# Load balancing

## Random

Chooses some backend from the provided list at random.

### Why use it?

If you want to introduce some chaos.

## First

Chooses the first backend from the provided list.

### Why use it?

If you explicitly want to use just one of the backends.

## Round robin

## Sticky round robin

### Why use it?

> Other services might employ caches to keep a userâ€™s state in RAM. This might be accomplished through hard or soft stickiness between reverse proxies and service frontends.
